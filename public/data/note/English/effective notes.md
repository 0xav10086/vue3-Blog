# Morse Code Method

The Morse Code Method is a note-talking method **envisioned** by Cal Newport and focus mainly in taking **advantage** of written materials.

Whenever you find a sentence that seems to be laying out a main idea, you should draw a dot next to it in the **margin**; if you then come across an example or **explanation** that supports that big idea you should draw a dash next to it on the margin.

This allows you to record information without breaking your reading **momentun** so you can then take notes.

The act of taking the dots you've written and transforming them into notes is called the processing stage and it basically requires you to paraphrase the main idea in your own words.

The author then encourages you to take all of these sentences and review them in the format of a major question.

'What is the main question being ask in the article?'

'What is the conclusion the authors point towards?'

## Noun Explanation

envision<br>
v. 想象；展望

advantage<br>

explanation<br>
n. 解释；说明；阐述；说明性文字；解释性说法

momentun<br>
时刻


# Flow Notes

Flow notes are very similar to mind maps but they have no rules in terms of structure.

Although difficult to review, they allow you to **incorporate** a large amount of information during your class because they are a free pass for you to simply throw facts, arguments, topics and dates on the page with no specific order while connecting and linking these ideas as you hear them.

Flow notes are great for those who hate **transcribing** information and prefer to process what they're hearing into workable sentences or words; it's a **holistic** method that works wonders for classes with no clear structure or discussion with interrelated components that aren't easily organized **via** outline or mind map format.

In case your class is highly dense on information, making it impossible to compress all of the facts, you can still use flow notes as a **hybrid** system to comment and **annotate** original materials and textbooks to create **summarise** or visual **aids** for complex chapters or topics.

## Noun Explanation
incorporate<br>
vt. 使并入；包含；合并；注册成立；吸收；将…包括在内<br>
adj. 无形(体)的；具体化了的；法定组织的；精神上的

transcribe<br>
v. 记录；抄录；把…转成(另一种书写形式)；改编(乐曲，以适合其他乐器或声部)；用音标标音<br>
n. 采谱

holistic<br>
adj. 整体的；全面的；功能整体性的

via<br>
prep. 通过，凭借（某人、系统等）；经过，经由（某一地方<br>
n. 管，道；道路，通路；<律>通行权

hybrid<br>
adj. 混合的；杂种的<br>
n. 杂种；(不同事物的)混合物，合成物；杂交植物；杂种动物

annotate<br>
vt. 注释；给…作注解(或评注)   

summarise<br>
网络 总结；概括；概述；汇总

aid<br>
n. 帮助；援助；(完成某工作所需的)助手；辅助设备；救援物资；辅助物；援助款项<br>
v. 援助；帮助

# Sentence Method

The sentence method is similar to the outline method as it relies on an expansive vision of your notes, but instead of using indenting and topic formulation, it uses one-liners, one per paragraph to create a guide for each topic that is easily readable, workable and memorable.

The other major different is that while the outline technique uses indentation to **hierarchize** the importance of **segments** of the topic by avoiding indenting the sentence method considers every sentence of equal value, which means that topics with a high-level of detail or information can benefit form this system as they force you to memorize details as well as key ideas relating to the topic.

## Noun Explanation
hierarchize<br>
网络 按等级排列；按级别排列；使成等级体系

segments<br>
n. 段；部分；片；弓形；(柑橘、柠檬等的)瓣；份；圆缺<br>
v. 分割；划分

# AD
And if you want to reproduce these note taking systems in on place only incorporate your notes with all of other information and materials related to your classes you should start using today's sponsor, Notion, as soon as possible.

Notion is an awesome tool and I've made three videos about how I use it to organize every single thing in my life and the good thing is that Notion is sponsoring today's video to let you know that it's finally free for students and teachers!

Notion is productivity software that combines all your essential work tools in one place.

It's flexible, allowing you to organize everything in workspaces and move things around seamlessly.

A weekly ago I showed you how I created an academic planner in Notion, which includes class notes, a calendar, syllabi pages, task lists, project planners etc. 

With this free personal plan for students, you can now have unlimited space to organize everything.

All you have to do is sign up your school email address or if you already have Notion, you can change your account e-mail to the e-mail of your school and that's pretty much it.

You can access a bunch of templates designed specifically for students and educators, which will be linked down below.

~~no link~~

Also, if you're curious about how I've been using Notion, I will link my past three videos as well.

I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you next week.

Bye Guys!
